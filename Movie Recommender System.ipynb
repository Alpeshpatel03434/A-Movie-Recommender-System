Amazon, Netflix, Google and many others have been using the technology to curate content and products for its customers. Amazon recommends products based on your purchase history, user ratings of the product etc. Netflix recommends movies and TV shows all made possible by highly efficient recommender systems."

    "Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous, and can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders.

    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering is also known as User-User Filtering. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one I will be using here is going to be based on the Pearson Correlation Function."

    "we're going to find out how similar each user is to the input through the __Pearson Correlation Coefficient__. It is used to measure the strength of a linear association between two variables. The formula for finding this coefficient between sets X and Y with N values can be seen in the image below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why Pearson Correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson correlation is invariant to scaling, i.e. multiplying all elements by a nonzero constant or adding any constant to all elements. For example, if you have two vectors X and Y,then, pearson(X, Y) == pearson(X, 2 * Y + 3). This is a pretty important property in recommendation systems because for example two users might rate two series of items totally different in terms of absolute rates, but they would be similar users (i.e. with similar ideas) with similar rates in various scales .\n",
